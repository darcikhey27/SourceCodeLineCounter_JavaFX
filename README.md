<<<<<<< HEAD
Write an interactive Java or C# program that asks the user for an absolute path to a directory that contains source files.  Also ask the user for the file extension for the source files (e.g java for Java files, cs for C# files, etc.). Report the following:
•	the number of source files processed
•	the total number of lines of code in all the source files
For our intents and purposes we will ignore blank lines in source files.  We will also ignore any lines that start with a comment (//) or are within a multi-line comment (/* */).
Extra Credit: If the directory contains sub-directories, process those as well.  Be sure and document that you implemented the extra credit if you expect to get paid for it!
